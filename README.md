## 🧠 What is JARVIS?

**JARVIS** is a **Python-based desktop voice agent** inspired by Iron Man’s assistant.  
The project demonstrates how **voice output, command processing, and OS automation** can be combined into a clean, modular system.

> ⚠️ Important Note  
> This project currently works as a **Voice Agent (rule-based)**.  
> It is **not a full AI/NLP system** yet — commands are matched using predefined logic.
